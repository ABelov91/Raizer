# Raizer

MATLAB package for calculation of plasma detailed ion compound via the improved Raizer method [1]. The package fits for stand-alone using and as a part of applied programs for gas dynamics with chemical kinetics. To test it, run "TEST.m". The EXAMPLES folder contains plots of results corresponding to input parameters specified by default in "TEST.m".
